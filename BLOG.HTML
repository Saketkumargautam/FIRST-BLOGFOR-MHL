      <h3>What is a hackathon?</h3>
      <hr />
      Hackathon is a tool to drive sustained innovation and crowdsource
      solutions to address pressing real-life business problems and social
      issues. <br />
      A hackathon is typically a time-bound competitive event where participants
      collaborate to build proofs of concept and minimum viable products for a
      specific pre-defined problem or to innovate.

      <ul>
        <li>
          To stay on top, try using organizing tools to track all aspects—
          technical, logistics, participation, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Choose the finalists from the idea submissions; get the best projects
          ready for the day of the hackathon.
        </li>
        <li>
          Arrange for workshops or information-sharing sessions for potential
          participants.
        </li>
        <li>
          Start sending reminders to attendees 7 to 10 days before the event.
          Finalize your speakers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Contact and sign on food caterers and miscellaneous vendors such as
          T-shirt suppliers. Get the travel itinerary of attendees and arrange
          for cost-effective and efficient transportation.
        </li>
        <li>
          In case of travel reimbursements, tell the participants how they can
          claim it and when. For participants who live in other countries, send
          an official invitation which makes apply for the visa easier. Get the
          final headcount.
        </li>
        <li>
          Confirm attendance a day prior to the event. Sometimes, half the
          people won’t turn up. Although you may be happy with the number of
          registrations, close to 30% do not submit a hack.
